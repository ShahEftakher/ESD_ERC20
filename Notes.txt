1. Create contracts in ./contracts
2. To configure network to run on custom ganache uncomment and update in truffle-config.js
    - development: {
       host: '127.0.0.1', // Localhost (default: none)
       port: 8545, // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
       network_id: '*', // Any network (default: none)
     },
3. This network can be configured for testnet as well
4. Token created using the ERC20 Standard from openzeppeline library
5. Users can directly interact with the token contract using metamask 
6. The public functions are accessible for the users to perform transaction
7. To allow external contracts to use Token, there must be some external functions
8. Use by external contract is not working. :(
